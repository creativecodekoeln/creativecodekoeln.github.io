# Creative Code Köln

Creative Code Köln is a diverse community of coders, artists, hobbyists, and anyone interested in the intersection of code and art. Independently of schools or institutions, our mission is to offer a safe space for everyone interested in code and art, no matter what your skill is!

Currently, we organize a meetup once a week, which is free of charge and open to everyone. There is no fixed format unless otherwise announced - you can show up whenever you want during the meetup, and bring your laptop to work on your projects, or simply talk about your ideas with other community members. Please check [Akkuraum meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/akkuraum/) for more details.

## Creative Coding

Here we do not define what creative coding is - to give you a hint, [processing.org](https://processing.org) has been an initiative in this field, but we are open to any tool for coding, and any medium for expression, from computer screens to body movements.

## Location

The meetup space is generously provided by [Akkuraum](https://www.akkuraum.com/) (Krefelder Straße 18c, 50670 Köln). After entering the gate on Krefelder Straße, continue on the parking lot and enter the building from Eingang C.

## Code of Conduct

We support the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/).
Please make sure you agree with its content - we will not tolerate any harassment.
